# Fun Little Side Projects

## Overview

- I've had a number of conversations where people tell me about how they want to work on side projects together.
- I realized that these people all want the same 3 things:

 1. To collaborate.
 2. To learn/play wth new technologies.
 3. To have fun.

- I created this organization in an effort to help make that happen :)
