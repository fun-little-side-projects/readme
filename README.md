# Fun Little Side Projects

## Overview

- Lots of people tell me about how they want to work on side projects together. This is a place for all those people to get together and do that.
- After having a few of these conversations, I realized that these people all wanted the same 3 things:

 1. To collaborate.
 2. To practice/learn/play around with new technologies.
 3. To have fun.

- Hopefully this organization and it's repos will be a place for that to happen.
